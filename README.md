# Todo_App-Ruby
ToDo_Board App -- written in Ruby

Part of my journey in teaching myself how to code. Starting at a place of close to zero knowledge-- I'm pretty proud of this rinky dink app...even if you can only use it via command line. Big props to App Academy Coding Bootcamp for making their full curriculum available for free online.
